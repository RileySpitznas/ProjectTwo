 A basketball is a spherical ball used in the sport of basketball. It is typically made of rubber or a synthetic material and has a textured surface to provide grip. The standard size of a basketball used in professional and collegiate play is about 29.5 inches (75 cm) in circumference and weighs around 22 ounces (620 grams).

 The design of a basketball includes a series of channels or grooves on the surface, which aid players in gripping and controlling the ball during gameplay. This texture helps players to dribble, pass, and shoot accurately.
